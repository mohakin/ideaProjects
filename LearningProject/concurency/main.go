// Concurency and goroutine -----------
// ------------------------------------
// Normally executions will start in order one after the other.
// By using Goroutines you can actually run your code concurently.
// In order to run something in paralell you must use the "go" function in front of your keywords.
// When running these functions as Goroutines we do not see the output in the terminal.
// This will not wait for the Goroutine to complete it will just dispatch for the Goroutine and then the program exits.
// This is how it is supposed to work. A solution to this is channels. A channel in go is simply a value that can be used as a channel when working with Goroutines.
// This is made with the make function.
// How it should look when using a channel that was called in a function is like so --- doneChan <-
// You should have your channel on the left with a "<-" operator and then what you want to pass to that channel on the right.
// You need to call out "<- done" so that go knows when to stop with the channel.
